LinearSearchBasic.java works but i'm not able to just print an Iterator object like in the rst forum example,
i needed to make some workaround. I had a problem importing standard java libraries in scripts but now seems to work.

In Testiamo.java there is a downcasting as in the example in the forum, why it works for them?
